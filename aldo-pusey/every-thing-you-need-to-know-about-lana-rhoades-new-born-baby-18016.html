The model announced her pregnancy not long after splitting up with her boyfriend, Mike Majlak.</strong></p><p>Many people believed Majlak was the child’s father as word of her pregnancy spread online and sparked interest in the baby’s father, gender, and other information. Majlak, on the other hand, swiftly disclaimed paternity upon the pregnancy announcement.</p><h2>Baby of Lana Rhoades</h2><p>Rhoades was supposed to give birth on January 13, 2022, but she was actually induced into labor and delivered the baby on January 7, 2022.</p><p>She posted pictures of her newborn on Instagram six days later, announcing that she had given birth to her “best pal in the whole wide world.”</p><p>She described how every day has been like Christmas morning since the birth of her baby. The new mother revealed the name of her kid, Milo, and exclaimed, “I am enjoying every second of being a parent and feel very happy!”</p><p>The post announcing the birth of her son had three images. A picture of a Panda Warmer, a device that keeps the infant warm, was displayed in the first. It was found that her child’s birth weight was 7 pounds, 3 ounces.</p><p>Another image showed her kid Milo dozing off in his recently decorated nursery. The third image was a photograph of her leaving her car parked at the “birthing mums” location. On January 15, 2022, Rhoades also tweeted images of her newborn.</p><p>A Twitter user questioned why Milo’s hands were covered as soon as she tweeted the picture. Quickly responding, the model disclosed that her child was born with dry hands and feet. She moisturized them and then had to cover them.</p><p>Before the bliss, Rhoades experienced a number of painful miscarriages. When she published a selfie of herself without a baby bump, claims that she was lying about being pregnant grew stronger due to her miscarriage experience.</p><p>People started enquiring as to if she was still carrying Milo. Is it just me, or does she not appear to have a bump? In response to Rhoades’ picture with a flat stomach, a follower tweeted, “Lana, I hope you’re not lying about your pregnancy.</p><h2>Showing Off Her Postpartum Belly Is Lana Rhoades</h2><p>On social media, Rhoades has been showing off her postpartum stomach. She uploaded a picture of herself removing her sweatshirt to show off her nearly flat stomach on January 13, 2022. The photograph was taken four days after Milo was born, she stated in the post.</p><p>In order to address her fans’ inquiries about her newly discovered parenting, Rhoades also created a separate story section. She claimed to have lost 1.5 pounds every day after giving birth in one account.</p><p>She reports that the night she went to the hospital, she weighed 164 pounds. Immediately after giving birth to her child, she lost 15 pounds.</p><p>The single mother highlighted that she needed to lose another 15 pounds in order to get back to her pre-baby weight of 120 pounds. She was currently 136 pounds.</p><p>Eight days after giving birth, she revealed in another story, she had returned to her workout regimen. She acknowledged using a treadmill with a 3.5 speed and an 8% incline to jog for an hour, twice daily, and burning 1000 calories.</p><p><span data-sheets-value='{"1":2,"2":"Also Read: Why Ed Skrein Left Game Of Thrones And His Family Life"}' data-sheets-userformat='{"2":37248,"10":2,"11":0,"15":"Arial","18":1}' data-sheets-hyperlink=https://popularbio.com/why-ed-skrein-left-game-of-thrones-and-his-family-life/ data-sheets-textstyleruns='{"1":0}{"1":11,"2":{"2":{"1":2,"2":1136076},"9":1}}' data-sheets-hyperlinkruns='{"1":11,"2":"https://popularbio.com/why-ed-skrein-left-game-of-thrones-and-his-family-life/"}{"1":65}'><a class=in-cell-link href=# rel=noopener>Also Read: </a><a class=in-cell-link href=# rel=noopener>Why Ed Skrein Left Game Of Thrones And His Family Life</a></span></p><span class=tag-title>Related tags :</span> <span class="tags-links clearfix"><a href=# rel=tag>Celebrity Mother</a></span> <a href=#></a><h3 class=small-font><a href=#>All About Corinne Gobert | Age, Net Worth, Bio, Career</a></h3>The name "Corinne Gobert" is widely recognized because her son, NBA player Rudy Gobert, hails from France and plays for the Utah Jazz.
