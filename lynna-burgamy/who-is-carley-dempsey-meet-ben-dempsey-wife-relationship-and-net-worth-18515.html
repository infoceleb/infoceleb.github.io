The fifth season, which will air in August 2022, was shot in Hamilton, Ontario, as opposed to the previous four seasons, which were produced in Southern California. Martin Short, a Hamilton native, appeared in the first episode as a cameo.</p><p>The subject of this conversation, Ben Dempsey, rose to social prominence after joining the show’s fifth-season cast. Ben’s exceptional physical abilities and ability to deal with adversity earned him a spot in the program.

Their love story evolved, and on September 30, 2022, they will walk down the aisle and exchange wedding vows. Through the ups and downs, they have remained steadfast in their love for one another.</p><p>Carley is not just Ben’s wife, but also his most steadfast ally, supporting him in all of his pursuits and freely expressing her admiration for him. Ben also stated that he enjoys spending time with his wife on beach trips and marine adventures because he loves the water. While Dempsey’s formative years at J.L. Ilsey High School were filled with good memories, he currently resides in Halifax, Nova Scotia.</p><h2>Ben Dempsey’s Family And Net Worth</h2><p>Ben Dempsey feels lucky to have grown up in a loving and supportive family.
