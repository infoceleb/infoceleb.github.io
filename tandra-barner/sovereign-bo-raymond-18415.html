He married Tameka Foster in 2007. Usher and Foster are the parents of two children: Usher Raymond V (born in 2007) and Naviyd Ely Raymond (2008).

Doctors declared Glover brain dead after he was taken to a nearby hospital.</p><h2><span id=Sovereign_Bo_Raymond-_Professional_Career>Sovereign Bo Raymond- Professional Career</span></h2><p>Her father Usher has always been a force in the music industry. He’s worked in a variety of musical genres, including R&B, blues, and pop. Following Usher (1994), his second album, My Way, was released in 1997. The album, which included the hits “Nice & Slow” and “You Make Me Wanna?” catapulted the young musician to popularity, selling over 7 million copies. Usher was soon praised for his smooth voice and catchy melodies. He was also noted for including sexual overtones in his songs, performances, and music videos.</p><p>Usher released Usher Live in 1999, followed by 8701 in 2001, which featured the No. 1 single “U Got It Bad,” as well as two Grammy Award-winning singles, “U Remind Me” and “U Don’t Have to Call.” 8701 sold almost 4 million copies in the United States alone.</p><p>Usher’s fourth studio album, Confessions (2004), was released over a decade after his first. The album sold over a million copies in its first week, and sales totaled around 20 million copies worldwide. “Burn,” “Confessions Part II,” and “Yeah!”—a collaboration with Ludacris and Lil Jon—were among the songs on the album.</p><p>Usher had an exceptionally outstanding track record by this point: he had 13 Top 20 hits, seven of which were No. 1 singles. At the Billboard Music Awards in 2004, he was named “Artist of the Year.” He won two People’s Choice Awards and three Grammy Awards a year later (best contemporary R&B album, best R&B performance by a duo or group, and best rap/sung collaboration).</p><p>Usher won two more Grammys after the release of Raymond v. Raymond (2010), for best contemporary R&B album (Raymond v. Raymond) and best male R&B performance (“There Goes My Baby”). Among other achievements, the singer has received 17 Billboard Music Prizes, eight Soul Train Music Awards, five Grammy Awards, and nine awards from the American Society of Composers, Authors, and Publishers.</p><p>He produced the album Looking 4 Myself, which debuted at No. 1 on Billboard’s albums chart in June 2012.</p><p>Usher started in March 2013 when he was working on his eighth studio album, UR, which he described as “more R&B, more urban” than his previous album Looking 4 Myself. Several songs from the album have already been released: “Good Kisser,” “She Came to Give It to You” featuring Nicki Minaj, and “I Don’t Mind” starring Juicy J.</p><h2><span id=Film_and_television_roles>Film and television roles</span></h2><p>Usher has worked as a film and stage actor in addition to his music career.

Usher debuted as a disc jockey in the film In the Mix in 2005, then a year later got the lead role of Billy Flynn in the Broadway play Chicago (2006).</p><p>Usher was named as one of the newest judges/coaches on The Voice, NBC’s iconic singing competition series, in 2012. On March 25, 2013, Usher made his Voice debut alongside Latin diva Shakira (the season 4 premiere). Usher and Shakira joined returning judges/coaches Adam Levine and Blake Shelton on the show, replacing Cee Lo Green and Christina Aguilera.</p><p>Usher’s unconventional tutoring method quickly gained over TV viewers. Despite his accomplishment, he and Shakira will miss the fifth season of The Voice for Green and Aguilera to return. However, Usher and Shakira will return as judges for the sixth season.</p><h2><span id=Other_Initiatives>Other Initiatives</span></h2><p>Usher is also involved with his charity, the New Look Foundation, which was founded in 1999 and works to provide funding for children in foster care and service programs; hold conferences and camps for at-risk youth; and, ultimately, promote leadership skills for children in impoverished communities. Usher has won recognition for his work with the nonprofits from organizations such as the Boys & Girls Clubs of America, the Trumpet Foundation, and the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People.</p><p>Usher has also invested in several business ventures.
