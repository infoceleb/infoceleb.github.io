Julia and Emma Roberts have always spoken highly of one another, and it’s clear that they’ve had a romantic relationship since Emma was a youngster.</strong></p><p>Emma was inspired to begin acting at the age of eight, and at the age of nine, she was cast in Blow alongside Johnny Depp and Penélope Cruz. She also appeared as an extra in America’s Sweethearts in 2001. She rose to prominence after modest roles in films such as Blow (2001) and the Nickelodeon television series Unfabulous (2004-07), for which she received a Teen Choice Award and six Young Artist Awards.</p><h2><span id=Is_Emma_Roberts_Related_To_Julia_Roberts>Is Emma Roberts Related To Julia Roberts?</span></h2><p>Emma Roberts is indeed related to Julia Roberts. Julia Roberts, an Academy Award winner, is Roberts’ niece. Emma, on the other hand, has not let this deter her from forging her own path in the industry. She’s 30 years old and has previously played the endearing, beloved nerd in a string of adolescent comedy, transitioned to horror in American Horror Story, and wonderfully captured life as a single twentysomething in the Netflix rom-com Holidate.</p><p>It would seem intimidating to have such a famous aunt, but Emma explained in a recent Tatler interview that she’s simply “doing her own thing.” Emma stated that as a child, she learned a lot about the industry by visiting her aunt on set. She was even allowed to try on some of the clothing on occasion. Emma revealed in a 2020 interview that there are photos of her on the set of Erin Brockovich toying with Julia Roberts’ movie clothes and posing in the wardrobe trailer.</p><h2><span id=Emma_Robertss_Family>Emma Roberts’s Family</span></h2><p>Emma Roberts is Julia Roberts’ niece and the daughter of actor Eric Roberts. Julia and Emma have had strained relationships with Eric in the past. Julia even supported Emma’s mother, Kelly Cunningham, as she battled for custody of Emma following her divorce from Eric.</p><p>She allegedly supported Cunningham’s legal battle because she believed her brother Eric, who was addicted to drugs and alcohol at the time, should not have full custody of Emma. Despite their quarrel, Julia and Eric reconcile, and Eric is able to mend his relationship with Emma. Julia’s close relationship with her niece, Emma, remained consistent throughout this family turmoil. Emma has spoken extensively about her experiences growing up on her famous aunt’s film sets and how they inspired her to pursue a career in acting.</p><h2><span id=Emma_and_Julia_Robertss_Net_Worth>Emma and Julia Roberts’s Net Worth</span></h2><p>She has a net worth of $25 million, according to wealthygorilla.com. Julia Roberts’ net worth, on the other hand, is expected to be $250 million as of 2023 by celebritynetworth.com. Emma and Julia Roberts have a $225 million net worth gap. Emma rose to notoriety as Addie Singer on the Nickelodeon television series ‘Unfabulous’ after making her film debut as Kristina Jung in the crime drama ‘Blow.’</p><p>Roberts is now regarded as one of the best actresses in the industry. After beginning her career in supporting or co-starring roles in films like “Mystic Pizza” and “Satisfaction,” Julia catapulted to popularity with her Oscar-nominated performance in “Steel Magnolias.” She became a significant breakthrough celebrity in 1990.</p><p><span data-sheets-value='{"1":2,"2":"Also Read: Without A Partner, Lori Pretty Feels Lonely"}' data-sheets-userformat='{"2":1081857,"3":{"1":0},"12":0,"18":1,"23":1}' data-sheets-textstyleruns='{"1":0}{"1":11,"2":{"2":{"1":2,"2":1136076},"9":1}}' data-sheets-hyperlinkruns='{"1":11,"2":"https://popularbio.com/without-a-partner-lori-petty-feels-lonely/"}{"1":54}'>Also Read: <a class=in-cell-link href=# rel=noopener>Without A Partner, Lori Pretty Feels Lonely</a></span></p><span class=tag-title>Related tags :</span> <span class="tags-links clearfix"><a href=# rel=tag>Celebrity</a></span> <a href=#></a><h3 class=small-font><a href=#>Harry Bates</a></h3>Harry Bates estimated Net Worth, Biography, Age, Height, Dating, Relationship Records, Salary, Income, Cars, Lifestyles & many more details have been updated below.
