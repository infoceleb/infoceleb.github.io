Gino Jenning was born in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, on February 10, 1963, to Bishop Ernest and his mother, Jennings. He is 58 years old right now. Gino was the fourth of five children in his family when he was born.</p><h2><span id=Career>Career</span></h2><p>Jennings has been a believer since he was a child. He grew up attending his uncle’s church, where he was a pastor. While working as the second-in-charge Pastor, Jennings was the leader’s Bible reader. He began preaching from the Bible at the age of thirteen.</p><p>Throughout his trip, Jennings frequently mentioned his God-given vision, which involved accomplishing big work involving a large number of people and congregations. He said that God spoke to him as a teenager and that he received an encouraging message. This drew a lot of attention, and it prompted others to pray to the Lord.<br>He was allowed to speak to the audience a year after he began preaching, but he was only allowed to teach what his Pastor had taught him. On May 17, 1984, the Holy Ghost commanded Jennings to break from his leader and preach his convictions, causing Jennings to labor according to his own beliefs.</p><p>Pastor Gino Jennings founded the First Church of our Lord Jesus Christ, Inc., which is now incorporated. The church was founded in the basement of Bishop and Mother Jennings’ home at 1335 West Jerome Street in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. The basement was eventually converted into an underground church.</p><h2><span id=Net_Worth>Net Worth</span></h2><p><b><span data-contrast=auto>Gino Jennings estimated Net Worth</span></b><span data-contrast=auto>, Salary, Income, Cars, Lifestyles & many more details have been updated below.
