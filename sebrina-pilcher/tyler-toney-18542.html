He’s had a lot of success since launching the channel in 2009.</p><h2><span id=What_is_the_Net_Worth_of_Tyler_Toney_Salary_Earnings>What is the Net Worth of Tyler Toney? Salary, Earnings</span></h2><p>Tyler Toney’s <strong>net worth</strong> is estimated to be at $4 million in early 2022. According to socialblade.com, the channel brings in roughly $12.7 million per year for the team, leaving Tyler with approximately $2.5 million as one of the five. In early 2020, their YouTube channel had around 50 million members.</p><h2><span id=Tyler_Toney-_Birth_Age_Ethnicity_Siblings_Education>Tyler Toney- Birth, Age, Ethnicity, Siblings, Education</span></h2><p>Tyler was born on March 24, 1989, in Prosper, Texas, USA, under the sign of Aries. Toney was reared in his birthplace by his Austin-based pastor father Jeff Toney and his mother Pam Toney of an unknown profession. Tyler has always had a significant interest in wildlife and marine species, as seen by his college degree and present activities.</p><p>He graduated from an unidentified high school in Texas in 2007, then enrolled in Texas Agricultural and Mechanical (A&M) University, where he earned a degree in wildlife and fisheries. However, it is unlikely that he afterward obtained employment that would require him to have this knowledge.</p><h2><span id=Tyler_Toney-_Relationship_Married_Life>Tyler Toney- Relationship, Married Life</span></h2><p>Tyler’s wife, Bethany Toney (née Briscoe), is said to have dated him for at least a few years before marrying him on October 21, 2011, in front of just close friends and family members. Bethany worked as a third-grade teacher before becoming a homemaker after graduating from Ouachita Baptist University with a degree in graphic design.</p><p>During her time there, she won the university’s beauty pageant.</p><h2><span id=Tyler_Toney-_Professional_Career>Tyler Toney- Professional Career</span></h2><p>Toney spent his free time in college practicing trick basketball shots in the backyard, often with a few pals.<br>The first video on the “Dude Perfect” YouTube channel dates back to 2009, and it shows Tyler and Cory Cotton playing a game of trick shots in which the bet was sandwiches. Cory uploaded it for fun, with no intention of actually developing his channel at the moment.</p><p>However, the unexpected 200,000 views in one week spurred the couple to reconsider, and they promptly released another similar video, this time taken at the Sky Ranch — a Christian summer camp. They were shortly approached by ESPN’s “E 60,” after which Tyler attended their studio and set a world record trick-shot. Soon after, the channel skyrocketed in popularity, earning endorsements and relationships with well-known athletes such as Sacramento Kings’ Tyreke Evans, National Basketball Association (NBA) star Chris Paul, and Green Bay Packers American Football quarterback Aaron Rodgers.</p><p>They also collaborated with luminaries from the entertainment world, including actor Paul Rudd, musician Luke Bryan, and country music singer Tim McGraw. Their channel hasn’t stopped expanding since its inception, and it already has approximately 10 billion cumulative views as of early 2020.</p><h3><span id=Meet_the_cast>Meet the cast</span></h3><p>Toney and Cory are joined on the channel by Cory’s brother Coby Cotton, Cody Jones, and Garrett Hilbert. To retain their popularity, the quintuple star squad relies on a variety of content types:</p><ul><li>Trick-shot videos — usually including, but not always limited to basketball throws.</li><li>Battle videos — competitions between individual members of the group or against celebrity visitors appearing on the show.</li><li>Overtime videos — a satirical mix of bits from all of the channel’s videos.</li><li>Stereotype videos — comedic videos that address one or more sorts of individuals by exaggerated activities that they are stereotyped for (e.g. throwing household items in their place as a basketball player)</li><li>Bucket List videos – realizing each group member’s craziest goals.</li><li>Games with Consequences — Individual or team-wide faceoffs in relatively perilous circumstances between the five and/or famous visitors.</li><li>Spreading like wildfire</li></ul><p>By 2011, the group had become so famous that they created their own eponymous free mobile game. Then came “Dude Perfect 2,” “That’s Lit,” and “Endless Ducker,” all of which revolved around performing various types of trick shots similar to those seen on the show. Aside from their mobile games, the group’s success skyrocketed once they were signed to Viacom’s CMT in September 2015, where they hosted “The Dude Perfect Show” in early 2016. The second season was then shifted to the Nickelodeon channel and premiered in July 2017. The final episode of the third season aired in May 2019, and the fourth is scheduled to premiere in 2020. Tyler has appeared in “Nickelodeon Kids’ Choice Spots 2015,” “Somebody’s Gotta Do It,” and “Bad Jokes.”</p><h3><span id=Establishing_a_precedent>Establishing a precedent</span></h3><p>Many “Dude Perfect” accomplishments have been recognized not just by fans, but also by Guinness World Records officials. In 2009, they broke the world record for the longest basketball shot with a shot from the fourth deck of Kyle Field. They also set the most recent record in this category, with a shot measuring 561ft (171m) from the top of the Reunion Tower. Tyler holds the world record for the longest distance walked barefoot on Lego.</p><p>Almost as soon as they started sharing movies on a daily basis, internet debate erupted over the validity of their images. They were immediately questioned by Tyler’s student newspaper, and according to their reaction in a 2009 article, Toney himself said, “The secret is all in the technique.” It’s more like a football than a basketball.</p><p>‘I played quarterback in high school, and I believe it helps me more than any basketball skills I may have.’ The group also disclosed that their trick-shot filming frequently entails more than one take. Finally, the shots are believed to be real, however many of them require a lot of work to perform in a single attempt.</p><h3><span id=The_true_scope_of_their_celebrity>The true scope of their celebrity</span></h3><p>“Dude Perfect” is now the second most-subscribed self-owned and unaffiliated YouTube channel, according to Wikipedia (10th overall). Only the famed PewDiePie is currently ahead of them, and this does not appear to be changing anytime soon.<br>His main source of inspiration is his faith.</p><p>Toney and the channel’s other four co-founders are all ardent Christians who believe their deity granted them this platform to inspire and aid others. “Dude Perfect” has been assisting children in need since the aforementioned Sky Ranch video. They began by promising to financially assist a child from Compassion International for every 100,000 views of the Sky Ranch video.</p><h2><span id=Body_Measurements_Height_Weight_Hair_color>Body Measurements: Height, Weight, Hair color</span></h2><p>Tyler Toney stands at a height of <strong>5ft 9ins (175cm) </strong>and has a <strong>weight </strong>of 178lbs (81kg).
