And now, two days later, on the occasion of the premiere of Christmas at Castle Hart, she wrote that the loss had crushed her heart.</p><p>Wendy, who was of Cajun (French), Italian, English, and Scottish descent, died at the age of 46. She was the daughter of Julie (Johnson) and Tony Chabert, a salesperson for the oil business.</p><p>Aside from her parents, she has two additional sisters, TJ and Chrissy, in addition to Lacey.</p><p>She shared a home in Texas with her husband, Shane Riggio, and their two sons. Her marriage life, on the other hand, was presumably not going well because she was going through divorce proceedings. She filed for divorce in August 2019, and the case is still pending.
