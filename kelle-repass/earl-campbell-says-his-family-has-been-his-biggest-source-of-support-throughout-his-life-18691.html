His house in the Houston region was another one of his possessions, and it was presumably sold for millions of dollars.</p><p>The former athlete has been enjoying his retired life with his family after a successful career and happy family life. But in the past, people started to worry and wonder, “Is Earl Campbell still alive?” But his declining health, which led to his weight loss, may have given grounds for concern.</p><p>Additionally, the 2009 death of his mother could have been misconstrued. However, the ex-athlete is doing well today and enjoying life with his family.</p><h2><span id=Earl_Campbell-_Birth_Age_Siblings_Education>Earl Campbell- Birth, Age, Siblings, Education</span></h2><p>The 66-year-old Earl-Campbell grew up in a large family in Texas with ten siblings. His propensity for sports was evident at a young age. While attending the University of Texas at Austin, Earl continued playing football to pursue his love of the game. He was selected in the 1978 NFL draft thanks to his stellar collegiate football career.</p><h2><span id=Earl_Campbell-_Relationship_Married_Life>Earl Campbell- Relationship, Married Life</span></h2><p>Earl and his wife Reuna Smith have been together since before Earl’s football career even got off the ground. On May 31, 1980, the couple, who started dating in junior high school, exchanged vows.</p><p>Nearly a thousand people attended the ceremony in Harvey Hall in Tyler, Texas. The bride and groom looked stunning in matching white clothes as they made their way down the aisle.</p><p>In the celebrity-studded nuptials, as reported by ABC 13’s Eyewitness News, Earl made the following vow:</p><p>“As long as I live, I will cherish, respect, and help her.”</p><p>Tyler and Christian Campbell are the children that Earl and Reuna have together. The former footballer and his wife have maintained their vow to stand by one other through every stage of life, and their marriage has lasted for decades.<br>However, Earl’s road hasn’t always been easy.</p><h2><span id=Earl_Campbell-_Professional_Career>Earl Campbell- Professional Career</span></h2><p>Earl-Campbell played for the Houston Oilers and the New Orleans Saints during his more than ten-year NFL career. Earl won the Ber Bell Award, was named NFL Most Valuable Player three times, was named NFL Offensive Player of the Year three times, was named NFL Rookie of the Year three times, and the list goes on.</p><p>He retired his jersey number 34 in 1987 and was widely regarded as one of the best running back players in the NFL.</p><h2><span id=Together_Despite_Everything>Together Despite Everything</span></h2><p>The NFL player experienced health problems later in life after retiring from sports, and he continued to take painkillers as directed. The former athlete became addicted to the drugs he was prescribed for his spinal stenosis in 2009. When his addiction spiraled out of control, Earl entered rehab the same year and later emerged sober.</p><p>The illustrious NFL star spoke to Chron about his life after recovery in the following ways:</p><p>“I’m having a great time.<br>When I was doing all of that, I believed I was enjoying myself as Earl Campbell.<br>But since I became clean, I’ve been having a lot of fun.”</p><p>But his family was a big part in helping him get through it. When discussing his family’s support for his sobriety, Earl said:</p><p>“I owe everything to my friends, family, the Lord, and my family.<br>I’ve been able to achieve what I’ve set out to.<br>And I agreed when my boys suggested seeking help to me.”</p><p>Earl-Campbell expresses gratitude to his family for being there for him through both his highs and lows. The former NFL player is not only endowed with a desirable personal life, but his professional achievements have also cemented his place in NFL history.</p><p>Also Read, <a href=#>Tom Stenberg</a>, <a href=#>Cyrus Michael Christopher Dancy</a>, and <a href=#>Morgane Stapleton</a>.</p><span class=tag-title>Related tags :</span> <span class="tags-links clearfix"><a href=# rel=tag>American Football Player</a></span> <a href=#></a><h3 class=small-font><a href=#>Tom Beier</a></h3>Tom Beier estimated Net Worth, Biography, Age, Height, Dating, Relationship Records, Salary, Income, Cars, Lifestyles & many more details have been updated below.
